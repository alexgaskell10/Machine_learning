\section{Overview}

We present our implementations of claim classifiers built using Keras and Tensorflow \cite{chollet2015keras,tensorflow} for the purpose of pricing automotive insurance, with training performed on a historical insurance dataset. In Part 2, we create a binary classifier to predict whether a client is likely to make a claim, and tune the classifier's model after addressing the imbalanced nature of the dataset. In Part 3 we develop a pricing model based on the claim prediction model from Part 2 coupled with a tuned severity model. This model is then tested and tuned based on its performance in a competitive insurance market populated with competing AI insurance policy offerers.
